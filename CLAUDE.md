## Developing the Plugin

Edit files directly in `plugins/dev-team/`. All plugin components (agents, skills, hooks) live there.

### Testing locally

Register the local checkout as a marketplace, then install from it into a test project:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add /path/to/agentic-dev-team
claude plugin install --scope project dev-team@bfinster
# Or from the published marketplace (GitHub):
# claude plugin marketplace add bdfinst/agentic-dev-team
# claude plugin install dev-team@bfinster
```

### Adding agents, skills, or hooks

- **Agent**: Add a `.md` file to `plugins/dev-team/agents/`
- **Agent-loaded skill**: Add a `SKILL.md` under `plugins/dev-team/skills/<name>/`
- **User-invocable skill** (slash command): Add a `SKILL.md` under `plugins/dev-team/skills/<name>/` with `user-invocable: true` in frontmatter
- **Hook**: Add a `.sh` script to `plugins/dev-team/hooks/` and register it in `plugins/dev-team/settings.json`

After changes, run `/agent-audit` to verify structural compliance.

### Releasing

Releases are managed by release-please. Push conventional commits to main:

- `feat:` → minor version bump
- `fix:` → patch version bump
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE` → major version bump

A release PR is opened automatically. Merging it creates a GitHub Release with a version tag.

See `plugins/dev-team/CLAUDE.md` for the full orchestration pipeline configuration.
